Mongoose is a ORM, basically it is used to set connection between your MongoDB and code. It is like an intermidiate between them..

when you using the Typescript, you first decide the data's type first -> interface common data type we used

All these schema are part of the Documnet so that we use like extends Document
this syntax tell us about the structure so,

exporting data in NextJs is very interesting thing,
In nextjs things run at edge time, when you created backend with the expresse 
then it run first getting schema and all then you made server and when you 
start later on because it initialze the first so it continue to working there 
is acknowledgement of the that server that it not started first,

But, in nextjs it does not know weather this application start first time or 
it start again and again or you mean 2nd time , so that is issue in the nextjs

that's why data export in the nextjs is slightly different, we gave two 
condition if it is first time or it already run first time just re run this 
srever

ZOD -> It is Typescript-first Schema Validation

DB connection is very easy task when you creating full backend server, when your application start and connected 
to the backend then it continuously start but in next this not happen in next it is edge time framework 
so, your application not running all the time, when user request come in the server then it backend server start, 
specially all next js function works on the time, but in othere backend you create and connect to the server then it 
remains continue 

void -> you learn in the cpp and void in the Typescript both are different started
in TS -> void is we don't care how data is comming in this situation..
